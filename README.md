TUM Introduction to Deep Learning (I2DL) | Exercise Solutions

There are 4 Exercises in total, where 3 of them consist of 2 sub-exercises. Each is given as a Jupyter Notebook. Dataset folders were removed intentionally due to the size and can be sent upon a request. You can find topic of each exercises below:

* Exercise 1: Image classification using 2 Layer Neural Network (core concepts implemented by us and then using pytorch to build the network).
* Exercise 2: Image classification using modular network design approach and more layers. Usage of Dropout and Batch-Normalization.
* Exercise 3: Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Semantic Image Segmentation.
* Exercise 4: Facial keypoints detection and MNIST dataset classification using Recurrent Neural Networks. 

## Note
Some of exercises have done on Amazon Web Services, that's why these exercises notebooks'(outputs of code) are not the latest version while the codes are up-to-date.
